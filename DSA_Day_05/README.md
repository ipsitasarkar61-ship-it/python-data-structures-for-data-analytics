# Day 5 – DSA Challenge (Python)

## 📌 Topic:
Finding the First and Last Occurrence of an Element in an Array

## 🧠 Problem Overview:
Given a list of elements and a target value, the task is to find the index of
the first and last occurrence of the target element.

This is a common array-based problem that helps build a strong understanding of
search logic and indexing.

## 📊 Relevance for Data Analytics:
This concept is important in data analytics for:
- Identifying the range of specific values in datasets
- Data filtering and segmentation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handling duplicates in real-world data

## 🛠 Approach:
- Traverse the array once
- Track the first index when the element is found
- Update the last index whenever the element appears again

## ⏱ Time & Space Complexity:
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## 🎯 Learning Outcome:
This problem strengthens logical thinking, array traversal skills,
and prepares the foundation for handling real-world datasets efficiently.
