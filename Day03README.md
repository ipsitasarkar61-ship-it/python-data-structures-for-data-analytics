# Day 03 – Valid Anagram (Python DSA)

This is Day 03 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, focused on building strong
Python DSA fundamentals required for Data Analyst roles.

## Problem
Given two strings, determine whether one string is an anagram of another.

## Approach
- Checked if both strings have equal length
- Used a HashMap (dictionary) to count character frequency
- Reduced count using the second string
- Returned false if mismatch occurred

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)

## Learning
This problem improved my understanding of string processing and hash-based
data structures, which are useful in data analytics tasks.
