# Day 02 – Contains Duplicate (Python DSA)

This is my second problem as part of the **100 Days of Code challenge**.
I am focusing on **Python DSA concepts required for Data Analyst roles**.

## 📌 Problem
Given a list of integers, determine whether any value appears more than once in the list.

## 💡 Approach (Using Set)
- Used a set to store already seen elements.
- Checked each element while iterating through the list.
- If an element is found in the set, a duplicate exists.

## ⏱ Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)

## 🛠 Language
- Python

## 🎯 Goal
To build a strong Python DSA foundation for Data Analytics and Analyst roles.
